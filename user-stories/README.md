### User Stories â€“ Airbnb Clone

This section contains the user stories derived from the use case diagram of the Airbnb Clone project.  

The stories describe interactions between different actors (guests, hosts, and admins) and the system, focusing on key features such as:  
- User management (registration, login, profile updates)  
- Property listings (adding, editing, searching)  
- Booking management (creating, canceling, tracking)  
- Payments (secure transactions, payouts)  
- Reviews and ratings  
- Notifications  
- Admin dashboard  

These stories will guide the backend development process by ensuring all user needs and system requirements are clearly captured.
